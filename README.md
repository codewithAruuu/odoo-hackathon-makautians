## 📖 Overview

**HR Management** is a web application for handling the everyday work of an HR team — keeping employee records in one place, tracking attendance and leave, and giving managers a clear view of their people. It's built on **TanStack Start** for a fast, type-safe, server-rendered React foundation, with **shadcn/ui** and **Tailwind CSS** powering the interface.
